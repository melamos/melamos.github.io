                <h3>Leading critical documentation programs (Puppet)</h3>
                <p>As the lead writer for Puppet Enterprise, the company's flagship commercial product, I owned end-to-end documentation, ensuring comprehensive feature coverage, coordinating release and publishing activities, and mentoring and editing junior writers. I also embedded with the installer engineering team and personally authored the most mission-critical documentation sections including installation, upgrading, system requirements, and disaster recovery. My work built documentation capacity while maintaining quality standards for the most business-critical product line.</p>

                <h3>Establishing systematic release operations (Puppet)</h3>
                <p>Without systematic release notes processes, product releases had inconsistent documentation quality and ad-hoc bug tracking that created confusion about issue status. I established comprehensive release notes standards defining content requirements, quality guidelines, and production workflows. I designed a label-based tracking scheme in Jira that enabled bugs to flow accurately from known issues to resolved issues through the release lifecycle. This systematic approach reduced release notes production time while improving content quality and stakeholder satisfaction. I've since implemented these same frameworks at AppOmni and Instabase, demonstrating their portability across organizations and product types.</p>

                <h3>Leading strategic content initiatives (AppOmni)</h3>
                <p>Without a structured process for major content decisions, competing priorities and stakeholder concerns were evaluated inconsistently, making it difficult to align cross-functional teams. I created a Request for Comments (RFC) process that enabled systematic evaluation of content challenges, potential solutions, audience needs, technical constraints, and implementation tradeoffs, with clear recommendations and supporting rationale. This systematic analysis often led to detailed tactical guidance, such as a comprehensive style guides covering security insights documentation.</p>
